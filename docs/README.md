# API Client Generator for C++

![release level](https://img.shields.io/badge/release%20level-%20alpha-red.svg)

A generator and runtime for protocol buffer described APIs for and in C++.

This repository contains two subprojects:
- An API client library generator, implemented as a protoc plugin
- A runtime library supporting the generated code (known as gax)

The generator takes APIs specified by protocol buffers, such as those inside Google,
and generates a client library.

**Note:** this project has been shelved. See [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md) for the current status of various features and designs.

## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). Please note it
is currently under active development. Any release versioned 0.x.y is subject to
backwards-incompatible changes at any time.

**GA**: Libraries defined at a GA quality level are expected to be stable and
all updates in the libraries are guaranteed to be backwards-compatible. Any
backwards-incompatible changes will lead to the major version increment
(1.x.y -> 2.0.0).

**Beta**: Libraries defined at a Beta quality level are expected to be mostly
stable and we're working towards their release candidate. We will address issues
and requests with a higher priority.

**Alpha**: Libraries defined at an Alpha quality level are still a
work-in-progress and are more likely to get backwards-incompatible updates.
Additionally, it's possible for Alpha libraries to get deprecated and deleted
before ever being promoted to Beta or GA.

 * retry policy, the client library will wait for an initial delay before
 * trying again. If the second attempt fails the delay time is increased by a
 * factor of 2. The delay time growth stops at a maximum delay wait time. The
 * policy also randomizes the delay each time, to avoid [thundering herd
 * problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem).

 * Note: The random number generator used when calculating backoff time in
